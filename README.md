The following data structures are implemented in this repository:

- **LinkedList**: Singly linked list, doubly linked list.
- **Stack**: Implementation of a stack data structure.
- **Queue**: Implementation of a queue data structure.
- **Tree**: Binary tree, binary search tree, AVL tree, etc.
- **Graph**: Graph representation and algorithms (e.g., BFS, DFS).

## **Algorithms** 🧠

Various algorithms are implemented in this repository, including but not limited to:

- **Sorting Algorithms**: Bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort, etc.
- **Searching Algorithms**: Binary search, linear search, etc.
- **Graph Algorithms**: Shortest path algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm), minimum spanning tree algorithms (e.g., Prim's algorithm, Kruskal's algorithm), etc.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Implementation of dynamic programming solutions to classic problems.

## **How to Use** 🛠️

Each data structure and algorithm is implemented in separate Java classes. You can simply clone this repository and import the desired classes into your project. Additionally, each implementation includes examples of how to use the respective data structure or algorithm.

To use a data structure or algorithm:

1. Clone this repository:
